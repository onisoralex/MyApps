Screen shift:
- the method shoud be able to go to specific coordinates like "screen 2; x=200; y=500" (done) or "screen 2; x=20%; y=50%"
- work with threads for the main method
-> one thread waits for the inputand starts the other thread
-> the other thread executes the switch and calcultions
-> thread one can also save when the user presses multiple times in order to execute every single press
--> the listening thread takes the new commands and waits for the first executing thread to finish,
    then starts aother one, insteadof just ignoring the new input
--> the listening thread could wait fore more input characters and loo if the dedicated key is one of them
    it should make a check every some milliseconds

!!!Bindings Object
1. take the bindings text file, read every line and copy them to a temporary .java-File. 
2. compile the .java-File and read the variables from the file as part of the already 
   Not just a read-from-file method, but more like the variables in the compiled file 
   are part of the running JAVA VM. If a variable is not specified in the File, there 
   should be a default value for the variable specified in the place where it is used, or another bindings 
   file should be used with the default values and the defaults will only be overriden

insert a "bindings" file, from which the settings will be read when the class initializes and localy save the settings.
instead of always readinng from the file, the program can read from the varibles directy instead.
read file into an object and access the variables from the object at initialisation.

the file will be converted into a java class file, initialized and by that
the variables will be set in the object if they exist in the object. Or the File that is converted
will be the object itself or part of the object.


Weighed Random:
- balanced Random Method 
  every Number is almost equaly often. generate a random number with a higher
  probability for the ones that have been cast lest often.
- percented peak random
